        <p>ACT IV</p>
        <P>(SCENE.—A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.)</P>

        <h6 class="secondCitizen">2nd Citizen.</h6><p class="speech"> No, I should think not.</p>
        <p class="speech">A Man in another part of the crowd. I say—who are we to back up in this?
             Another Man, beside him. Watch Aslaksen, and do as he does.</p>
        <h6 class="Billing">Billing </h6><p class="direction">(pushing his way through the crowd, with a writing-case under his arm).</p>
           <p class="speech">Excuse me, gentlemen—do you mind letting me through? I am reporting for the
            “People’s Messenger.” Thank you very much!</p>
            <p class="direction">(He sits down at the table on the left.)
