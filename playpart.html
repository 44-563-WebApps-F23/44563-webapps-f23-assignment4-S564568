        <p>ACT IV</p>
        <P>(SCENE.—A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.)</P>
        <h6>1st Citizen.</h6><p> He couldn’t even get the loan of the hall at the Baths.</p>
        <h6>2nd Citizen.</h6><p> No, I should think not.</p>
        <p>A Man in another part of the crowd. I say—who are we to back up in this?

            Another Man, beside him. Watch Aslaksen, and do as he does.</p>
        <h6>Billing </h6><p>(pushing his way through the crowd, with a writing-case under his arm).</p>
           <p>Excuse me, gentlemen—do you mind letting me through? I am reporting for the
            “People’s Messenger.” Thank you very much!</p>
            <p>(He sits down at the table on the left.)
            </p>
        <h6>A Workman.</h6><p>Who was that?</p>
        <h6>Second Workman.</h6><p>Don’t you know him? It’s Billing, who writes for
            Aslaksen’s paper.</p>
        <h6>Aslaksen </h6><p>(going up to HORSTER).</p><p>Has the Doctor not come yet?</p>
            
        <p>(CAPTAIN HORSTER brings in MRS. STOCKMANN and PETRA through the door on the
            right. EJLIF and MORTEN follow them in.)
        </p>
        <h6>Horster. </h6><p>I thought you might all sit here; you can slip out easily from here,
            if things get too lively.</p>
