        <h4>by Henrik Ibsen</h4>
        <p>ACT IV</p>
        <P>(SCENE.—A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.)</P>
        <p>1st Citizen. He couldn’t even get the loan of the hall at the Baths.</p>
        <p>2nd Citizen. No, I should think not.</p>
        <p>A Man in another part of the crowd. I say—who are we to back up in this?

            Another Man, beside him. Watch Aslaksen, and do as he does.</p>
        <p>Billing (pushing his way through the crowd, with a writing-case under his arm).
            Excuse me, gentlemen—do you mind letting me through? I am reporting for the
            “People’s Messenger.” Thank you very much! (He sits down at
            the table on the left.)
            </p>
        <p>A Workman. Who was that?</p>
        <p>Second Workman. Don’t you know him? It’s Billing, who writes for
            Aslaksen’s paper.
            
            (CAPTAIN HORSTER brings in MRS. STOCKMANN and PETRA through the door on the
            right. EJLIF and MORTEN follow them in.)
            </p>
        <p>Horster. I thought you might all sit here; you can slip out easily from here,
            if things get too lively.</p>
